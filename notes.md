## Fast and safe systems programming with Rust

Ideas for talk:
* Introduction: why C and C++ are so popular, where Rust fits in and why it is 
  exciting.
* Three pillars of design
    * Abstraction without overhead
    * Memory safety without garbage collection
    * Concurrency without data races
* Features
    * trait-based generics
    * pattern matching
    * sensible build systems!
    * namespaces
    * modules
    * "blisteringly fast"
    * type inference
