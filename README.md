# Let's get rusty!
## Fast and safe systems programming!

*Rust* – what is it?  Rust is a systems programming language as fast as C and C++, but without the horrible capacity for memory danger.

*Imagine*: freedom from the horrors of out-of-bounds access, use-after-free, data races – without sacrificing speed!

Not only does Rust guarantee memory safety, but it brings with it the joy of namespaces, trait-based generics, pattern matching and *gasp* sensible build systems.

This repo has my notes in `notes.md` plus some other materials :)
